	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I love being a web developer because I love development. I have done a lot of web development and there are a lot of parts to it. The part that I love is that I can build something and I can see it immediately. I can send it to people. I can show it to people. People can interact with it.</p>
